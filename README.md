Data analysis of Lego dataset using Python

Lego barely needs any introduction. Everyone loves Lego (unless you ever stepped on one). The variously colored interlocking plastic bricks accompanying an array of gears, figurines called minifigures, and various other parts have remained a big hit since they were first released in 1949.

As of July 2015, 600 billion Lego parts had been produced. This project focuses on exploring Lego data to provide some statistics regarding Lego and answers following questions(dataset for span of 1950-2017):
* What is the average number of Lego sets released per year over the total time span of our data?
* What is the average number of Lego parts released per year?
* What are the 5 most popular colors used in Lego parts?
* What proportion of Lego parts are transparent?
* What are the 5 rarest lego bricks?

Methods:
1. Database querying using PostgreSQL
2. Visualization using Python libraries : matplotlib, seaborn
3. Pandas for data exploration 

The data was provided by Rebrickable.com and be accessed through [LEGO Catalog Database Downloads](https://rebrickable.com/downloads/).

(This work is part of learning python from DataCamp.)
(There are more than 1 file out of which 1: Basic Data exploration 2. Answering questions mentioned above)
