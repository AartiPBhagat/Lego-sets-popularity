# Lego-sets-popularity
(Beginner data analysis of Lego(popular game) dataset first using Python and then SQL)

Everyone loves Lego (unless you ever stepped on one). Did you know by the way that "Lego" was derived from the Danish phrase leg godt, which means "play well"? Unless you speak Danish, probably not.
This small project analyzes a fascinating dataset on every single Lego block that has ever been built!

## Challenges:
1. The number of colors available for Lego game sets
2. Proportion of Lego sets having transparent colors
3. Variation in average number of Lego parts over years
4. Lego game themes over years and unique themes for specific year
